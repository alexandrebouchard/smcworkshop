Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are broadly used to
approximate posterior distributions of hidden states in state-space
models by means of sets of weighted particles. While the convergence
is guaranteed when the number of particles tends to infinity, the
quality of the approximation is usually unknown but strongly
dependent on the number of particles. In this talk, we propose a
novel methodology for assessing the convergence of the SMC method
in an online manner, as well as a simple scheme for the online
adaptation of the number of particles based on the convergence
assessment. The methodology is based on a sequential comparison
between the actual observations and their predictive probability
distributions approximated by the SMC method.
