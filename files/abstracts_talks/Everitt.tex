Whole genome sequencing has had a big impact in studying the evolutionary history of pathogens. At the core of many studies is the need to infer the clonal ancestry of a sample from sequence data. This is usually performed using a Bayesian approach, with a coalescent prior on ancestries, and using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference. However, MCMC can be computationally expensive, and is inflexible in that it needs to be run from scratch whenever new data is received. This talk describes work on a sequential Monte Carlo approach to inference in models with coalescent priors. The proposed approach is also applicable to Bayesian model comparison. An application to mixtures of Gaussians is presented, in which a deterministic transformation is used to improve the efficiency of the SMC.
