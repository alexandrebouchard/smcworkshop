I will describe algorithms for numerical approximation of the gain function in the feedback particle filter. The exact gain function is the solution of a Poisson equation involving a probability-weighted Laplacian. The numerical problem is to approximate this solution using only particles sampled from the distribution.  For the solution of this problem, a kernel algorithm will be presented along with certain asymptotic estimates for bias and variance.  Comparisons with the ensemble Kalman filter will be described and also illustrated with results from some numerical experiments.
