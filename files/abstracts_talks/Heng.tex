In this talk, we introduce a class of controlled sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers, that can be applied to both static
models and state space models, and show connections with existing
work. We provide theoretical analysis of our proposed methodology
and demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art methods at a
fixed computational complexity.
