Direct application of importance sampling can perform badly in high
dimensions, in the sense that for even very simple examples involving
densities on $R^d$, computational effort much be increased
exponentially with $d$ in order to prevent the Monte Carlo variance
of importance sampling approximations from exploding.
The purpose of this talk is to illustrate that when the basic
importance sampling idea is applied in a more sophisticated manner,
which involves an importance sampling correction between the laws
of certain diffusion processes constructed in terms of the target
distribution known as Jarzynski's identity, the exponential growth of
computational cost with dimension can be avoided. The assumption
of log-concavity of the target distribution furnishes the diffusions in
question with some appealing ``dimension-free" ergodic properties.

This is joint work with Christophe Andrieu and James Ridgeway.
