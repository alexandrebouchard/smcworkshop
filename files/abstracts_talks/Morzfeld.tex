The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a reliable data assimilation tool
for high-dimensional meteorological problems. On the other hand,
the EnKF can be interpreted as a particle filter, and many particle
filters (PF) collapse in high-dimensional problems. We explain that
these seemingly contradictory statements ofer insights about how PF
function in certain high-dimensional problems, and in particular
support recent eforts in meteorology to ``localize'' particle filters, i.e.
to restrict the influence of an observation to its neighborhood.
