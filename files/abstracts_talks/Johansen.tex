We present an ofine, iterated particle filter to facilitate statistical
inference in general state space hidden Markov models. Given a
model and a sequence of observations, the associated marginal
likelihood $L$ is central to likelihood-based inference for unknown
statistical parameters. We define a class of ``twisted'' models: each
member is specified by a sequence of positive functions $\psi$ and
has an associated $\psi$-auxiliary particle filter that provides
unbiased estimates of $L$. We identify a sequence $\psi^\star$ that is
optimal in the
sense that the $\psi^\star$-auxiliary particle filter's estimate of $L$ has
zero variance. In practical applications, $\psi^\star$ is unknown so the $\psi^\star$-auxiliary particle filter cannot straightforwardly be
implemented. We use an iterative scheme to approximate $\psi^\star$, and
demonstrate empirically that the resulting iterated auxiliary particle
filter significantly outperforms the bootstrap particle filter in
challenging settings. This method is particularly well suited to
approximate simulation of diffusion bridges as is shown by the
empirical study.
