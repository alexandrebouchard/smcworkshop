This talk discusses variance estimation in sequential Monte Carlo
methods, alternatively termed particle filters. The variance estimator
that we propose is a natural modification of that suggested by H.P.
Chan and T.L. Lai [A general theory of particle filters in hidden
Markov models and some applications. Ann. Statist., 41(6):
2877--2904, 2013], which allows the variance to be estimated in a
single run of the particle filter by tracing the genealogical history of
the particles. However, due particle lineage degeneracy, the estimator
of the mentioned work becomes numerically unstable as the number
of sequential particle updates increases. Thus, by tracing only a part
of the particles' genealogy rather than the full one, our estimator
gains long-term numerical stability at the cost of a bias. The scope of
the genealogical tracing is regulated by a lag, and under mild, easily
checked model assumptions, we prove that the bias tends to zero
geometrically fast as the lag increases. As confirmed by our
numerical results, this allows the bias to be tightly controlled also for
moderate particle sample sizes.
