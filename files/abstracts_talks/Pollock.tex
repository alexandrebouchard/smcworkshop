This talk will introduce novel methodologies for exploring posterior distributions by modifying methodology for exactly (without error) simulating diffusion sample paths. The methodologies discussed have found particular applicability to ``Big Data" problems. We begin by presenting the Scalable Langevin Exact Algorithm (ScaLE) and recent methodological extensions (including Re-ScaLE, which avoids the need for particle approximation in ScaLE), which has remarkably good scalability properties as the size of the data set increases (it has sub-linear cost, and potentially no cost as a function of data size). ScaLE has particular applicability in the “single-core” big data setting - in which inference is conducted on a single computer. In the second half of the talk we will present methodology to exactly recombine inferences on separate data sets computed on separate cores - an exact version of ``divide and conquer''. As such this approach has particular applicability in the ``multi-core'' big data setting. We conclude by commenting on future work on the confluence of these approaches. Joint work with Hongsheng Dai, Paul Fearnhead, Adam Johansen, Divakar Kumar, Gareth Roberts.
