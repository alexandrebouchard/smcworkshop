Variations in the ambient magnetic field can be used as features in
indoor positioning and navigation. Here a probabilistic Gaussian
process regression based framework is used for composing the
vector field magnetic map. The map matching (positioning) is based
on a particle filter, and follows the classical terrain matching
framework used in aircraft positioning and navigation. The feasibility
of this terrain matching approach is demonstrated in real-life indoor
positioning examples, where both the mapping and positioning are
done using a smartphone.
