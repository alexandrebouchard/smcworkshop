This talk covers some new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the
error introduced by the resampling step of a particle filter. General
conditions are given for the consistency of the resampling scheme. It
is also shown that, standard resampling schemes may be modified in
a certain way so that the mean square error is $o(N^{-1})$.
Joint work with Mathieu Gerber, and Nick Whiteley, both from Bristol
University.
