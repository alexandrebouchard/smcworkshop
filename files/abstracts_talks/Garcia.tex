In this talk, a variety of novel SMC samplers are introduced for
inference in two model classes: an infinite mixture model with
Poisson-Kingman priors and a finite mixture model where a prior
over the total number of components is used. Successively, I discuss
how a sequential Bayesian hypothesis test can be performed, based
on Bayes factor estimates for each model class, to compare the two
competing hypotheses. This is possible because of the availability of
model evidence estimates from the SMC output. I also present some
preliminary experimental results of computational performance and
of the Bayes factor test.
