Demand for data science is rapidly growing. However, many
commercial and scientific data sources present fundamental
inferential challenges. Examples include the prevalence of mixed data
types, convenience samples with tens or hundreds of uncontrolled
variables, complex multivariate outcomes, incomplete measurements,
coding errors, measurement noise, irrelevant variables, and limited
causal knowledge. A key bottleneck is hiring individuals with the
necessary education and statistical judgment to address these
challenges.
This talk will describe BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform
for AI-assisted data science that has been developed over the last 10
years. Novice BayesDB users can answer data analysis questions in
seconds or minutes with a level of rigor that otherwise requires hours
or days of work by someone with advanced training in statistics plus
good statistical judgment. BayesDB also provides advanced
probabilistic programming capabilities that enable experts to
integrate causal domain knowledge and black-box machine learning
with hierarchical Bayes.
Examples will be drawn from both commercial partnerships and
collaborations with philanthropic organizations such as the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation.
