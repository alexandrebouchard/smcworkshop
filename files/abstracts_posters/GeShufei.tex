%%%%%%%%%%   Type your abstract below


In this paper, we propose an online Bayesian clustering method for the stream type of spatial temporal data based on mixtures of spatial spline regressions. MCMC is derived to make inference for the parameters in our proposed model. However, MCMC has to be rerun when new data arrive. To address this issue we propose an online SMC algorithm for our model. The data augmentation and mixture proposal improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our method is demonstrated by an application to  tumor image data.
