%%%%%%%%%%   Type your abstract below
For problems involving large data sets, it is often practical or necessary to distribute the data across multiple processors. Consider a target probability density function expressed as a product of terms, each being the contribution of one such subset of the data. We introduce an instrumental hierarchical model, associating a parameter vector with each subset; these parameter vectors are conditionally independent when conditioned on a top-level parameter. This permits the construction of a Gibbs sampler that yields an approximation of the target density as a marginal of its invariant distribution. Specifying the conditional distribution of the artificial parameter vectors allows the trade-off between computational tractability and fidelity to the original model to be controlled, which may be achieved using a sequential Monte Carlo approach. In contrast to similar such algorithms, this approach requires no assumptions of approximate Gaussianity; we present promising empirical results in such cases, and initial investigations into the algorithm's theoretical properties.
