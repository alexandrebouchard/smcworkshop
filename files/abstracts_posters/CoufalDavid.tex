%%%%%%%%%%   Type your abstract below
The upper bounds on kernel density estimates in particle filtering are derived for the Sobolev class of filtering densities. 
The bounds assure the convergence of kernel density estimates to the filtering density at each filtering time, provided 
the number of generated particles goes to infinity. The result is achieved by means of Fourier analysis. 
The lower bounds are discussed as well. They are delivered using the standard approach from non-parameteric
estimation that employs tools from information theory. The lower bounds meet upper ones, which indicates
optimality of the kernel density estimates in particle filtering.
