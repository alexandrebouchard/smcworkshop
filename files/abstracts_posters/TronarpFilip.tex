Functional connectivity is an important topic in neuroscience which can serve as a tool for basic research as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis by, for instance, aiding in localisation of brain regions generating epilleptic seizures. Estimating the functional connectivity involves four components (i) determining the number of electromagnetic sources (ii) determining the location of the sources, (iii) determining the strength (dipole moment) of the sources and (iv) determining their statistical interdependence. The current standard in the neuroscience community is to use a two-step approach where (ii) and (iii) are solved by, e.g, minimum norm estimation after which (iv) can be solved, however this induces a bias \cite{EMBEC17}. Here the problem is tackled by assuming the solution to (i) is known a priori while a state-space model is formulated for (ii) and (iii) given (iv), where the latter is assumed to impose linear dependence between sources. The problem is thus reduced to identification in a non-linear state-space model with a linear sub-structure which is solved by a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter combined with an expectation-maximisation algorithm. The proposed approach allows for reconstruction of neural sources and connectivity in a realistic and continuous head model \cite{XiChen}.
