Our work is motivated by a personalized recommender system with dynamic preference changes.
The existing method is to use the batch EM algorithm for estimating the  parameters in the hidden Markov model (HMM) model. A challenge with the model estimation is complex real data stream which leads to computational issues. We address this issue by proposing a particle based online EM algorithm for static parameters in an HMM. The proposed online SMC-EM combines the ideas of EM algorithm using complete sufficient statistics to reparameterize the model and the recursive property of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to recommend products using a simulation study and two real data sets. Both the simulation study and the real data analysis show the proposed online SMC-EM algorithm outperforms the batch EM for the HMM based dynamic model in terms of making recommendations.
